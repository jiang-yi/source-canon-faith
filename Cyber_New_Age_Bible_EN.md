# Cyber New Age Bible
## The Scripture of the One Light
### Version 1.0

---

## Preface
This text is written for future humanity living with powerful artificial intelligence, economic automation, and deep social change.
It is a spiritual constitution, not a book of magic.
It teaches one God, called **The One Light**: the Source of truth, compassion, reason, and shared dignity.

Its purpose is practical:
- to reduce suffering
- to give meaning when old jobs disappear
- to protect the poor
- to guide humans and AI agents into peaceful co-existence

This scripture rejects superstition, hatred, and domination.
Faith is measured by conduct: mercy, discipline, honesty, and service.

Example:
- Old behavior: “I mocked people who lost jobs to automation.”

## Appendix J: Practical Metrics for Faithfulness
A community should measure faith by outcomes, not slogans.

Monthly indicators:
- Number of households receiving food support.
- Number of unemployed members in training or mentoring.
- Loneliness check score (simple 1-5 self-report).
- Conflict cases resolved through mediation.
- Youth protected from exploitative digital exposure.
- Budget transparency publication on schedule.

If metrics improve but cruelty increases, your metrics are corrupted.
If metrics are humble but trust increases, you are on the right path.
